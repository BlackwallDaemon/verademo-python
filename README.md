## About

Blab-a-Gag is a fairly simple forum type application which allows:

- Users can post a one-liner joke.

- Users can comment on other users messages (heckle).

### URLs

- `/feed` shows the jokes/heckles that are relevant to the current user.
- `/blabbers` shows a list of all other users and allows the current user to listen or ignore.
- `/profile` allows the current user to modify their profile.
- `/login` allows you to log in to your account
- `/register` allows you to create a new user account
- `/tools` shows a tools page that shows a fortune or lets you ping a host.
- `/reset` allows the user to reset the database
